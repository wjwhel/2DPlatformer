What is the main action in the game:

The goal of the game is to make your way through and kill all enemies including a final boss. Enemies are spawed at certain locations that start to track the player
when within a certain range. The game is a 2D side scroller the character can be controlled using AD, Space to jump and left click to attack enemies, killing them after x amount of attacks dependant on the amount of health that perticular enemy has. Player health and stamina is displayed on the top left hand corner, losing health when being attacked by 
enemies and losing stamina when attacking, which then slows regenerates over time. If the player dies the game is over and you have to start from the beginning, killing the 
final boss wins you the game.

What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal:

The most difficult part was player interactions with different enemies. Dealing with collisions, attacking different enemies, the blueprints were easy to use after learning 
since they are just a high level version of programming i already know but they became quite a mess and hard to follow once you accounted for multiple interactions with 
different enemies which had their own sprites than ran for x amount of time. This held me back with finishing everything and making the game longer/more enjoyable.

What is the most interesting part of the game:

The most interesting part again would be player/enemy interaction, fighting the different typed of enemies dealing different amount of damage. Although not smart i thought
the simple AI of the enemies following/tracking you was interesting and simpler than i thought to set up.
